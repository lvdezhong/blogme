## Install

There are two ways to get started with this blog.

1. Use after the Repository Fork
1. Use after the Repository Clone

### ! Important

**Don't work on master branch.**

If you go through the steps above, the branch you're working on is develop.
Start working on this develop branch. You can modify the develop branch or create a branch separately from the develop branch.

The master branch is used for deployment, and the built file is located.
You can work on the develop branch and deploy it using the deploy command.
The deploy command automatically deploys to the master branch, which does not have direct access.

### 1. Use after the Repository **Fork**

- After Fork the Repository,

1. `Setting > Option - Repository name`
   Rename the Repository to "**username**.github.io"
1. `Setting > Branches - Default branch`
   Change the default branch. Select **develop** and press the Update button to proceed.
1. clone your Repository.
1. `$ npm i` install packages
1. `$ npm start` Start local development environment
   Check URL "localhost:8000"

### 2. Use after the Repository **Clone**

```shell
$ git clone -b develop --single-branch https://github.com/junhobaik/junhobaik.github.io.git [SITE_DIRECTORY]
$ npm install
```

This procedure clones the repository based on the develop branch.
Then install the required packages.

```shell
$ npm start
```
Start local development environment
Check URL "localhost:8000"

## Writing posts

Posts are written in Markdown.

- Markdown
- emoji support
- ktex support

Your post will be located in the `./_posts` folder.
Your draft post will be located in the `./_drafts` folder. (Draft posts are visible during local development, but not on the distributed web)
The `_posts` folder and the` _drafts` folder must exist. ** Do not delete both folders **

The title of the file becomes the address of the post post.
If a date is entered, such as in Jekyll's post file title format, the date is excluded from the address.

ex 1. `./_posts/first-post.md`
address: https://junhobaik.github.io/first-post

 2. `./_posts/2019-12-31-first-post.md`
address: https://junhobaik.github.io/first-post

**Create post with image**

When embedding an image inside the markdown, the structure is as follows

Example of creating a post that will have an address of `/first-post`
After creating `./_posts/first-post` folder,
Markdown files have the title `index.md`,
Place image files in that folder.

```
  _posts/
    first-post/
      index.md
      image-file-1.png
      image-file-2.jpg
      ...

```

### Series Posts

When you write several posts on one subject as below, you can use the series function to indicate that the post is included in the series.
With the series feature, you'll see a list of series posts at the top of the post.

-Create a blog, install
-Create a blog, setting up
-Create a blog, Distribution

If you write a post like this, write the file name as below.

- `development-blog_1.md`
- `development-blog_2.md`
- `development-blog_3.md`

The number after the underbar(\_) is the number of the series.
The file name before the underbar(\_) must be the same.
There must be only one underbar(\_) in the file name.
Do not mix numbers and letters after the underbar(\_).
